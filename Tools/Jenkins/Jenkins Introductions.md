# Jenkins Introductions

### What is Jenkins?
- Jenkins is an open source automation server. 
- It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery. 
- It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. 
- It supports version control tools, including AccuRev, CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, ClearCase and RTC, and can execute Apache Ant, Apache Maven and sbt based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands.

### History
- The Jenkins project was originally named Hudson, and was renamed in 2011 after a dispute with Oracle, which had forked the project and claimed rights to the project name. 
- The Oracle fork, Hudson, continued to be developed for a time before being donated to the Eclipse Foundation. 
- Oracle's Hudson is no longer maintained and was announced as obsolete in February 2017.
- Around 2007 Hudson became known as a better alternative to Cruise Control and other open-source build-servers. At the JavaOne conference in May 2008 the software won the Duke's Choice Award in the Developer Solutions category.
- During November 2010, after the acquisition of Sun Microsystems by Oracle, an issue arose in the Hudson community with respect to the infrastructure used, which grew to encompass questions over the stewardship and control by Oracle. Negotiations between the principal project contributors and Oracle took place, and although there were many areas of agreement a key sticking point was the trademarked name "Hudson," after Oracle claimed the right to the name and applied for a trademark in December 2010. As a result, on January 11, 2011, a call for votes was made to change the project name from "Hudson" to "Jenkins." The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by community vote on January 29, 2011, creating the Jenkins project.
- On February 1, 2011, Oracle said that they intended to continue development of Hudson, and considered Jenkins a fork rather than a rename. Jenkins and Hudson therefore continued as two independent projects, each claiming the other is the fork. As of June 2019, the Jenkins organization on GitHub had 667 project members and around 2,200 public repositories, compared with Hudson's 28 project members and 20 public repositories with the last update in 2016.
- In 2011, creator Kohsuke Kawaguchi received an O'Reilly Open Source Award for his work on the Hudson/Jenkins project.
- On April 20, 2016 version 2 was released with the Pipeline plugin enabled by default. The plugin allows for writing build instructions using a domain specific language based on Apache Groovy.
- Jenkins replaced Hudson since February 8, 2017 in Eclipse.
- In March 2018 Jenkins X software project for Kubernetes was publicly presented,with support for different cloud providers including AWS EKS among others.

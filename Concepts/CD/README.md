#Continuous Delivery (CD)

- Software Development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production
- Continuous Delivery (CD) expands upon Continuous Integration (CI) by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage
- When properly implemented, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process. 

###Benefits:
- Automate the Software Release Process
- Improve Developer Productivity - more productive by freeing developers from manual tasks and encouraging behaviors that help reduce the number of errors and bugs deployed to customers
- Find and address bugs quicker -
